    <h1>Create a Boot Disk to Reset Your Windows Password</h1>
    <p>Hopefully you've never had to experience the trauma of forgetting a password to a computer. Obviously, it's not the end of the world when it happens, and there are ways of getting around a login password without any harm to you or your computer. Today we are going to bestow this sacred power into your mortal hands.</p>
    <p>You'll need:
      <ul>
        <li>USB drive</li>
        <li>Windows computer or laptop</li>
        <li>Administrator account access</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download Password_Reset_Creator.zip</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>Open up a web browser and navigate to http://tinyurl.com/ENGL316-pw.
        This will download Password_Reset_Creator.zip.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Extract the contents of the zip file</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>Open up your downloads folder, right click 'Password_Reset_Creator.zip', and select "Extract All".
          Click the extract button when a popup comes up to confirm the location to extract it to.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Run 'createdrive.bat' as administrator</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>In the newly opened folder, right click 'createdrive.bat' and select "Run as Administrator".</p>
        <img src="images/run-as-administrator.png" alt="" />
        <p>Select "Yes" at the prompt.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Confirm the flash drive to use</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>If you have more than one USB drive inserted, you will be prompted to choose which one to erase.
        The script will then ask you to confirm your choice.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
          <strong>Caution!</strong> All data will be erased from the flash drive! Please backup any data on the flash drive beforehand, and make sure you are using the correct drive.
        </div>
        <img src="images/script-running.png" alt="" />
        <p>Once you type 'Y' for yes, press the enter key and watch the script run.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Exit the program and restart Windows</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>The script is finished when it says "Press any key to exit..."</p>
        <img src="images/script-finished.png" alt="" />
        <p>Exit the window and shut down the computer. You've now built the boot disk and put it on a flash drive.
        The next steps will show you how to use it.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Boot from the USB drive</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>When you turn your computer back on, look at your screen for an option that says "Boot Options", "Boot Menu", or "Startup Device".
          The specific hotkey may differ depending on what computer you use, but the hotkey should be listed next to the options listed on screen.
          Press that button as the computer starts up.</p>
        <img src="images/choose-boot-menu-vmware.png" alt="" />
        <p>Next, choose to boot to the USB drive.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, you'll see this loading screen.</p>
        <img src="images/loading-screen.png" alt="" />
        <p>This menu will come up next.</p>
        <img src="images/main-menu.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>Select an RID</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>On this screen, you'll see a list of usernames and RIDs.
          Type in the RID to the left of the username you want to reset the password for.
          In this case, we want to reset the password for alyssa's account, so we type in "03eb".</p>
        <img src="images/choose-user.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>Clear the password</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>Next, enter 1 to clear the user's password.</p>
        <img src="images/clear-password.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>Quit and write hive files</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>Now that the user's password is cleared, we can exit and reboot the computer.
          Press 'q' in the User Edit Menu and Main Menu to quit the program.</p>
        <img src="images/quit-edit-user.png" alt="" />
        <p>When it asks to "Write hive files?", make sure to enter 'y'! Otherwise, your changes will not be saved.</p>
      </div>
      <li>Reboot Windows and login</li>
      <div class="step">
        <p>Finally, reboot Windows. Now you can login without a password to the account you edited! Congratulations!</p>
      </div>
    </ol>
    <p id="conclusion">And just like that, you're a personal computer system administrator. If you have a random PC that's account is locked, you can now get back in and use it like normal.</p>
